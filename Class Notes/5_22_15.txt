Programming in Assembly

Relative Speed
    Synchronization is important
    Asynchronous Events
    I/O Handshaking

Time Behavior
    
I/O Data Ports

Status Ports

Interrupt Processing
    Thread mode vs handler mode
        bit 24?
        normally 0
        Exception occurs, set to 1
        Exception response preserves old content from
         status register
         
Exceptions
    Definition: any condition that needs to halt the normal
     sequential flow of instruction execution
    Categories
        reset
        svc supervisor
        loss of power
    Attributes
        An exception number
        priority level
        exception handler routine
        entry in the vector table
Exception Response
    Instructions always stored in evens
    
Exception Return    

Latency
    Reduction
        Abandoning or suspending instruction to start exception response
        Late Arrival processing
        Tail-Chaining
