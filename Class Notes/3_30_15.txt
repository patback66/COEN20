Chapter 2: Data Representation

Kinds of Data
-Numbers
    -Integers
        -Unsigned
        -Signed
    -Reals
        -Fixed-point (This is what we'll use)
        -Floating-point
    -Binary-Coded Decimal
-Text
    -ASCII Characters
    -Strings
-Other
    -Graphics
    -Images
    -Video
    -Audio
    
Positional Nunber Systems
    -Numeric values are represented by a sequence of digit symbols
    -Symbols represent numeric values
        -not limited to 0-9
    -Each symbol's contribution to the total value of the number is weighted according to its position in the sequence
    
Polynomial Evaluation
    Whole Numbers (Radix = 10)
    
Coverting Radix R to Decimal
    36.78 (8) = 3*8^1 + 6*8^0 + y*8^-1 + 2*8^-2
              = 24 + 6 + 0.875 + 0.03125
              = 30.90625 (10)

Variation on Polynomial Evaluation for converting fractional Values

Decimal to Binary Conversion
    -Whole part -> repeated division
        457/10 = 45 R 7
        45/10 = 4 R 5                           ---- 4/10 = 0 R 4
        5/10 = 5 R 0
    
    Algorithm
        Divide by target radix
        remainders become digits in the new representation
        digits produced in right to left order
        quotient is used as next dividend
        stop when quotient becomes zero, but use the corresponding remainder
    
    -Fractional part -> repeated multiplication
        .xxx(10)
        
        .[0]1
        2 * .xxx(10) -> X.xxx where X = 0 or 1
        2 * .17 (10) = [0].34
        2 * .68 = 1.36
        
    swimming metaphor
        XXXXXXXXXXXXXX.xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
        right to left   left to right
        
        
    Need to decide if you throw away (truncate) or round
    
    if(x==0.1)...... NO
    if(fabs(x-0.1) < .0001)..... Yes
    
    12011.201 (3) = ?(9)
    power relationship 3^[2] = 9
    so 12|20|11|.|20|10
