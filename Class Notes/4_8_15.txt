Embedded system:
    minimize cost
    Cheap processor
        possibly no multiply or divide instructions
        or they are very slow
        
Mumltiplication/Division by constants
    1) Constant is a power of 2
    2) Arbitray Constants
    
Arithmeetic Shifting

Dividend
            odd     even
    pos     +       +
    neg     off     +
    
    off by 1 (too negative)
    

Integer division
    truncate, remove the fractional part
    truncation during integer division truncates towards 0
    
Arithmetic shift right
    truncates towards -infinity
    
chary x,y;
    y=x/5;
    y=(x*(256/5))>>8;
        //double length product (16 bit product)
        //keep most-significant 8 bits
        
8 bit example
    A/y -> A * (256/7)
    A*.36
    
    Ex: A = 100
    100/4 -> 14 R 2
    A*36 = 3600 = E10 = 0000 1110 0001 0000
    
Multiplication & Division by C=2^k
    left shifts
    
Multiplication and Division by C!=2^k, arbitrary constant
    combination of shifts, additions, and subtractions
    
Signed vs Unsigned Multiplication
