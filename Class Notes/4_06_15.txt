Floating Point Representation

Representation of Characters
    store 8 bit binary pattern
    charc c;
    c = 'A'; //actually 01000001
    printf("%d", c); // 41 b16
    
    Except for character escapes

Representation oof strings
    strings vs string constants
    
CHAPTER 3

Which is Greater: 1001 or 0011
    depends on interpretation
    Hardware implementation can do both, just need to know how to 
        interpret 
        
Subtraction
    -N = N_bar +1
    
Multiplication
    Max number digits you can get as a product:
        sum of num digits in multipliers
        
        a = b * c;
        single mul instruction
        R3 <- R1 x R2
        all 32 bit
        
        ((long long) a) x ((long long) b)
        64 bit * 64 bit, result is 128 bit. But only get 64 bit back
