3 Places where shifting is used in ARM Instructions
    1) Address Calculation
        Ex: LDR R0,[R1,R2,LSL#2]
                           Only Use LSL
                   [Starting address of array, subscript
                           
   2) As a shifted operand
        MOV R0,R1,ASR#31
            sign extend, shift right for sign bit
            any shift operator is possible
   
   3)
   
   
Types of Shift Operators
    use s to capture from carry flag, else will not be modified
    
    
Double Precision left Shift
    R0 gets LSH, R1 gets MSH
    
    should be able to LSR, ASR
        of 64 bits
