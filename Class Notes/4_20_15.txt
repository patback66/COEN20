Separate Memory & I/O Busses

The Fetch Phase

result <- op1 + op2
    Replace accumulator with register
    
CISC (Intel)
    complex instruction set computer
    1/2 control logic
    ~several hundred instructions
    ALU
    ACC/Registers (a few ~8?)
    
RISC
    Reduced instruction set computer
    ~50 - 100 instructions
    
    Less control logic than CISC
    More ALU, Registers (16-32)
    Longer instruction sequences because less instructions
    
WE USE Load/Store Architecture
    these are the only instructions that can access memory
    still net savings of program size
