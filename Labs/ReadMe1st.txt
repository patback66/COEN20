There are ten lab assignments to complete – one per week. 
The first six assignments may be completed using any C compiler. 
The last four are a mix of C and ARM assembly and require the use 
of the C programming environment provided by IAR Embedded Workbench.

C Programming Assignments

1.	Integer Arithmetic Exercise (old Lab 1)
2.	Read an signed/unsigned decimal integer and print it in binary
3.	Read a binary string and print it as signed/unsigned decimal integer
4.	Convert: N to –N using binary strings
5.	Binary addition, subtraction using binary strings
6.	Unsigned multiplication using binary strings

C and ARM Assembly Assignments

7.	Integer Functions using straight-line assembly (absval, disc)
7.	Integer Functions using loops in assembly (sqrt, exp)
9.	Multiplication with 64-bit integers
10.	Unsigned Division of 64-bit dividend by 32-bit divisor
